Heya, I'm Luc Angevare. I have been programming in Python since I was 11 and I have been trying new things ever since. My biggest goal is to become a professional developer and my current goal is to make a virtual, voice-controlled, NLP assistant.<br>
I love getting feedback and improving so please, if there's anything I can do better or should change, please tell me!<br>
Mostly what inspires me is learning, challenging myself and making new things, pushing myself out of my comfort zone to try and expand it.<br>
